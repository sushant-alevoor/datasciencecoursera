# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the R script `run_analysis.R` that processes the UCI HAR Dataset to produce a tidy dataset with readable variable names
and average for each variable for each subject and activity. 

## Steps Performed in Project
1. Downloaded and unzipped the dataset.
2. Merged training and test data.
3. Extracted only mean and standard deviation measurements.
4. Applied descriptive activity names.
5. Cleaned variable names, removed unneccessary characters for clarity
6. Created a second tidy dataset with averages.

## Files Within Repository
- 'run_analysis.R': Main analysis script.
- 'CodeBook.Rmd': Describes all variables in the tidy dataset.
- 'tidy_dataset.txt': Output tidy dataset.
- 'README.Rmd': Readme file to give an overall description
